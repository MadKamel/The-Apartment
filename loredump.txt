Apartment takes place shortly after Pyro's Quest, after the cult is defeated. The cult has developed a way to cause large-scale demonic possession by releasing nerve agents that are designed to induce immense suffering without killing the victim, while at the same time feeding evil into the victim's mind. This makes them fertile for demonic possession. The cult releases the agent as a last-ditch effort to muster up some semblance of a fighting force.

After the events portrayed in Pyro's Quest, Irkae and Colin (Pyro) manage to kill the controller of the demon horde, leading the city of zombies effectively aimless. Irkae and Colin procure gas masks from the cultists and enter the city, aiming to eradicate the demons.

Apartment's protagonist is the player's character. They are the sole survivor of their town, which has suddenly become overrun with zombies- demons possessing afflicted humans. The player character has congenital analgesia and isn't aware that they are supposed to be in pain, and so do not suffer. This means they are immune from the possession, but they are still mentally affected. They become more wrathful and effectively act as a loose cannon in combat.
