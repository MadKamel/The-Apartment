The player enters a courtyard in such a way that he cannot go back. Irkae is leaning against the balcony. He turns to face the player.
"Hey there! You don't look like a zombie! What's goin' on with you?"
Irkae stands there, waiting for a response.
"Cat got your tongue? Alright, you look like you could use a gun though. Here, I have this spare fifty cal, put it to good use, yeah? Go kick ass!"
Irkae tosses his gun down and heads inside the building. He calls out to the player, now out of sight.
"Oh, lemme unlock that gate!"
A gate that was locked suddenly opens.
"Good luck, mate!"
